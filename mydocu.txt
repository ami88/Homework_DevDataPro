Documentation for my Shiny application
======================================

This is a very simple application to play with the normal distribution. It does not need any additional package to run it, other than shiny. I assume that the user is using RStudio.

* How to run it?

As any Shiny app. Open the ui.R and server.R files in your RStudio enviroment and click in the "Reload App" buttom.

* What you will see?

A window with a sidebar Panel and a main Panel.

- The sidebar Panel controls the input.
- The main Panel displays the output.

The attached presentation myPresentation.md contains info about the specific input and output. I copy and paste here:

## Inputs
- Mean: A slide to chose the mean of the distribution. Range: -90,90
- Std Dev: A slide to chose the standard deviation of the distribution. Range: 0.1,20
- Two checkboxs to decide whether one wants to see label in the axes
- X0: Value at which I want to evaluate the probability < or >.
- A last checkbox to decide whether I want lower or upper tail 
## Outputs
- A plot of the distribution (black)
- A vertical line (red) at the value X0 overplotted
- The probability
